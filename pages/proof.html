    <p>User Interface (UI) design is more than just aesthetics—it's a strategic tool that shapes how people interact with technology. From streamlining tasks to influencing decisions, good UI design can make or break digital experiences.</p>
    <p>On this page, you will be introduced to the philosophies of key figures in the design world, such as Jony Ive and Jakob Nielsen, who advocate for user-centred principles.</p>
    <p>For those wanting to dive deeper, this section includes links to academic research and case studies that offer insight into how UI design contributes to usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction across various fields. Whether you're a student, designer, or simply curious, this collection aims to reinforce why UI is not just relevant—it's essential.</p>

            <p>Sir Jony Ive has long championed the importance of user interface design as a bridge between complex technology and human experience. In his work, he consistently emphasizes that great UI should feel intuitive, allowing users to engage with a product without conscious effort or instruction.</p>
            <p>He was also part of the original team of Apple designers that launched the first iPhone, and is largely credited for the minimalistic design of the iPhone and iPad. Ive believed in putting the user at the heart of the product experience.</p>

            <p>Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D., is widely regarded as the “king of usability” in the field of Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). His work has transformed how we understand user-centered design.</p>
            <p>From 1994–1998, He led usability efforts for SunWeb — the company’s early website and intranet — and helped shape the now-crucial field of web usability. He also held influential positions at IBM, Bellcore, and leading academic institutions including Aarhus University and the Technical University of Denmark. A true pioneer, Jakob has been inducted into the Scandinavian Interactive Media Hall of Fame and received SIGCHI’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013.</p>
