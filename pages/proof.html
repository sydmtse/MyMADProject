        <p>If you are still not convinced, then let me provide some more concrete evidence.</p>
        <p>The advancement of digital systems has meant a rapid evolution in today's professional, educational, and social terrain. These systems have altered how we work, learn, and connect tremendously, and with it, the importance of effective User Interface (UI) design has become clearer than ever. Communicating the value of UI - and designing interfaces that are both practical and cost-effective - is essential in ensuring systems are usable, logical, and accessible across contexts. </p>

        <q>A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.</q>
        <p2>— Martin LeBlanc, designer & founder of Iconfinder</p2>

        <p>A common misconception is that UI simply refers to how screens look. Not quite. UI design encompasses much more than visual aesthetics - this includes ALL elements influencing the interaction betwwen a user and the system, from: the layout, the behaviour of interactive elements, and the overall ease of use. In other words, UI involves everything a user sees, experiences, and does within a digital system.</p>

        When the interface is poorly designed, it becomes a barrier to the functionality of the underlying system, limiting the user's ability to engage with its full potential. This limitation can create serious disadvantages—not just commercially for businesses competing in digital spaces, but also in terms of personal growth, communication, and audience engagement. In digital-first environments, your interface is your first impression. Whether you are an organization, an artist, or a student, a well-designed UI is the first point of contact with your audience, setting the tone for the entire experience.</p3>

        Looking at UI design from a theoretical lens, the design community has, over the last few decades, developed a core set of components that apply universally across platforms—whether on desktop, mobile apps, or web interfaces. These standards allow designers, researchers, and critics to evaluate UI consistently across hardware and content types. According to Marcus (1998, 2001), a communication theory-based approach, rooted in semiotics, offers a powerful framework for understanding how UI functions. Drawing from the work of theorists like Eco and Peirce, this approach views UI as more than a technical layer—it is a form of interactive visual literature and a cultural artifact. This interpretation aligns with Lévi-Strauss’s view of humans as makers of both tools and symbols, emphasizing that UI design is not just functional, but deeply human.</p4>
