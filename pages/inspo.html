        <h3>WHAT MAKES A GOOD UI DESIGN?</h3>
    </div>
        <p>Today's UI design is a multi-faceted field with different perspectives, expertise,and disciplines to consider. To help you begin, consider these 4 pro tips:</p>

                <h4>1.  PUTTING THE USER FIRST</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Remember that user interfaces exist for the user, and no one else. So at each step of your process you shuld be asking: "How will this impact the user?" If its anything other than "it makes their life better or easier," then you might want to rethink your choice.</p>
            <p>Great UI doesn't just cater to users - it gives users a sense of control. Simple user interfaces that are clean, intuitive, and seamless are easier to use, and won't need a tutorial to understand.</p>
            <p>You can achieve this by:</p>
            <p>* Relying on familiar patterns and best practices"</p>
            <p>* Making it easy to undo changes or fix mistakes</p>
            <p>* Removing distractions</p>
            <p>* Ensure feedback to user actions are timely</p>

                <h4>2.  WELL INFORMED</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Even if you're a UI pro, UI needs change depending on the needs of its customers to inform your design.</p>
            <p>Doing a quick analysis, will help you to understand:</p>
            <p>* Know your target audiences' expectations - If your idea, project, or product (you could be the product you're trying to sell) is new to the market, you'll need to understand what your audience is expecting from your competition. Using a competitor analysis to evaluate top products or those who have already been successful, can help inform you what some key elements are needed to stand-out.</p>
            <p>* Apply UI standards - These are the written and un-written rules of well-made UI, so you can understand the basics and how to elevate. If you don't these yet, don't worry, we hope to get you covered!</p>
            <p>* Test & solve often - Usability testing can usually reveal somethign your initial design left out. This could be a peer-review, or drawing on inspo from other designers and how they managed to overcome the same issue.</p>
