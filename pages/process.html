                <p>The aims of effective project management is to break the larger project down into smaller manageable steps. We did so with the help of our peer groups.  Working collaboratively ensures my design is not just based on personal preference but tested by real users and peers. The supportive and constructive environment also helps maintain motivation and well-being during the project development process.</p>
                <p>Oultine of my project:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>who - young professionals</li>
                  <li>what - importance of UI design</li>
                  <li>why - benefits to personal branding and understanding of systems across multiple fields</li>
                  <li>how - a page that centralizes resources and clear explanation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our group agreement:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>establish caring and supportive environment</li>
                  <li>listen and don’t judge</li>

                  <p>After deliberation and discussion with my group, its clear this updated design includes added navigation and space for greater content to be showcased. The layout of the wireframe also feels more sensical as each button will take you to a seperate scrollable page, organized by content category - About/general info, academic backing/proof, inspiration, and finally the process work when building the page.</p>

                <div class="toggle-content">
                  <p>Value of prototyping and user feedback with wireframes:</p>
                  <p>Ability to visualize the layout and structure of my site early on, without needing to code everything from the start. It gives a clear sense of the user journey, helping me focus on functionality and hierarchy before aesthetics.</p>
                <p>How testingimpacted my key components:</p>
                <p>The feedback I received during testing made me rethink some elements of my design. For example, some users found the original navigation too subtle and didn’t realize there were multiple scrollable sections. As a result, I’ve decided to make the navigation bar more visible and interactive, possibly adding hover states or audio cues. I also got suggestions to simplify some components to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once, which led me to rework the visual hierarchy and reduce the number of items shown on the homepage.</p>
                <p>Next steps:</p>
                <p>I plan to conduct a second round of user testing once the updated wireframes are done. This time, I’ll create an interactive prototype using a tool like Canva, allowing users to click through the site as they would in a real experience. I’ll ask them to complete simple tasks (e.g., “Find the UI advice for beginners”) and observe where they hesitate or get confused. I’ll collect feedback through a short survey and a follow-up discussion, which will inform the final design adjustments before full development.</p>

                <p>Aspects I wanted to test:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Scroll-based navigation – Can users smoothly navigate between the vertically stacked sections on the homepage?</li>
                    <li>Understanding of purpose – Can users understand what the site is about and who it's for within 30 seconds?</li>
                    <li>Clickable elements and interactivity – Do users recognize which buttons are interactive (e.g., "Compare & Contrast", "Inspiration")?</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Things I observed:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>How long it takes them to complete the task.</li>
                  <li>Where they get stuck or scroll unnecessarily.</li>
                  <li>Whether they click the intended sections</li>
                  <li>Any confusion over layout or function.</li>
                </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>I think the structure of the website is perfect: simple and snappy. It's really crucial to get it right, as the credibility of the content may depend on how well the website is executed.</li>
                  <li>Defining UI would help connect the website to the intended audience. It seems that the audience that are most likely to benefit from the website may be unfamiliar with the term.</li>
                  <li>Maybe a brief mention of the technology stack or tools could enhance clarity.
                  </li>
                  <li>more real-world UI examples be included to illustrate good vs. bad design</li>
                  <li>Demonstrating actual case studies might make the points more impactful.</li>
                <li>This presentation effectively highlights the importance of UI design, particularly for young professionals. The bold color contrast and structured layout make the slides visually striking.</li>
